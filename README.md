# Skinline AI - Revolutionizing Skin Disease Detection with Deep Learning

Skinline AI is a groundbreaking deep learning project aimed at revolutionizing skin disease detection. By simply inputting an image, our innovative system can accurately detect various skin diseases, providing a swift and accurate diagnosis. Our model has been meticulously trained on a diverse dataset, enabling it to recognize 12 different diseases across 6 major classes.

## Technical Details
- **Model Architecture**: Skinline AI is powered by a custom implementation based on the ResNet50 model, ensuring robust and accurate predictions.
  
- **Dataset**: We have curated a comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 1800 high-resolution images of skin diseases. These images cover 12 diseases categorized into 4 major classes:
  - **Bacterial**: Cellulitis, Impetigo
  - **Cancerous**: BCC Carcinoma, Melanoma
  - **Fungal**: Athlete's Foot, Nail Fungus, Ringworm
  - **Inflammatory**: Acne Vulgaris, Rosacea
  - **Parasitic**: Cutaneous Larva Migrans
  - **Viral**: Chicken Pox, Shingles
  
- **Training Process**: Through the use of libraries such as OpenCV and multiple epochs of selective training, we have achieved an impressive validation accuracy ranging between 85-90%.

- **Integration**: This model has been seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly website, designed to be a one-stop solution for individuals seeking information and diagnosis for skin diseases.
